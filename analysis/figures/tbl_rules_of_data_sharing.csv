Rule,Details
Anticipate how your data will be used,"Before collecting data, decide what formats and metadata schema will be used, how and where the data will be archived, embargoed, released, and what software others are likely to use to work with your data."
Keep raw data raw,"Data should be as unprocessed as possible, within practical limitations, to facilitate future analysis with new methods. The line between raw and derived data is not often clear, so the general idea is to provide data that will enable others to confirm your analytical results, assess the validity of your statistical output, or directly compare findings across other studies. "
Store data in open formats,"Data should be in a format that is easily readable by computers, without being dependent on specific software. Examples of open data formats include comma-separated values (CSV) for tabular data, portable network graphics (PNG) for images, and KML (or other Open Geospatial Consortium [OGC] format) for spatial data. Examples of closed formats include Photoshop document (PSD) for bitmap images, and Microsoft Excel (XLS) for tabular data. While day-to-day work may require closed formats, the files that are archived should be in open formats."
Data should be structured for analysis,"Data should be structured so it is easy to analyse with a computer, and easy to combine with other datasets. For tabular data, each variable or measurement should be a single column, each observation or record should be a single row, and each type of observational unit should be a table. Each cell should contain a single value, not include units, comments or derivative values (such as percentage) in the same cell as the value. Be consistent with capitalisation, abbreviations, naming conventions, and avoid exotic characters such as accents that may not be readable on other systems. Use a good null value such as a blank cell or NA. Don't use spaces in column names. "
Data should be uniquely identifiable,"Data used in a scholarly publication should be archived online at a location that can be uniquely identified by a persistent URL or a or a Globally Unique Identified/Universally Unique Identifier (GUID/UUID). Types of persistent URLs include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), or a persistent URL (PURLs). Individual files should have a distinct names, which includes a version identifier. This identifier could be the date in the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DD, i.e. from largest time unit to smallest)."
Provide relevant metadata,"Include information about what, when, where, and how of the data were collected. For tabular data, this should include descriptions of the column names, units of measurement, warnings about missing or inconsistent data, and information to check that the data are complete (e.g. the number of rows and columns that are in the table when it was created)"
Adopt the proper privacy protocols,"Take care not to include data that might expose people, places or objects to risk of harm or loss. Negotiating with stakeholders such as Indigenous groups is essential to avoid harm in data sharing. This might include omitting or degrading location data (e.g. so that site locations are not revealed to the public), and removing or anonymising personally identifiable information. Methods for ensuring privacy can be complex and change rapidly, so seeking expert help may be necessary."
Use a trustworthy repository ,"Data should be easy to find and available for a long time. Archive your data in a major well-established repository that provides persistent URLs and has a commitment to sustainability (e.g. participates in the CLOCKSS archive). Do not use your personal website or a project website, which may change or disappear."
Use an open license,"Data should have an explicit and well-established license to let others know exactly what they can and cannot do with the data you shared. One of the most widely used and frequently recommended license is CC-0 or public domain. This places no restrictions on data use, promoting greater engagement with the data."
